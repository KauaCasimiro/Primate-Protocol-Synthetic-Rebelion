## 🎮 About the Game

In a futuristic zoo where the staff consists of androids, drones, and robots, something went terribly wrong.  
A digital virus known as **V1RU5** has taken over the system...  
Now, the zoo workers — infected and transformed into zombie-like machines — rebel with fury in the very place they once controlled.

You are a **cyborg primate**, a forgotten government project reactivated to contain the rebellion.  
Fight through waves of enemies and survive.
